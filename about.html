          I enjoy playing video games in my free time! Playing shooters and rpg
          games are my top favorites I can get lost in for hours! Some of my favorite 
          games currently are Sims4, COD, God of War, Spider-Man and Dead by Daylight.

          One of my all time favorite movies is Resident Evil: Retribution. The
          fight scenes are epic and I really enjoy the simulation part of it!
          The resident Evil series is my favorite in the horror genre, but I 
          enjoy watching comedy and anime as well.

        <p>Another thing I enjoy is weight lifting. A few years back I competed in 
          competitions in Denver, Colorado where in the two competitions I've competed
          in I have placed first and second respectively. Currently I just enjoy
          weight lifting to keep sane ðŸ¤ª
